Reproducibility

9.5/10

Readme file – 4/4

Good readme file, I was able to easily understand what all of the different files are and how to unpack the data.

Notebook file -  3.5/4

The code runs and it is easy to understand what is in the different parts. I had a few issues with the “path” variable at first, maybe a PC/Mac issue?

Git repo – 2/2

The directory structure is well organized. 

Comments:
-	For the final version, be sure to focus on interpreting results shown in graphs.
-	Is there a way to estimate error of parameter estimates? Maybe this doesn’t matter if you will be running ANOVA on replicate samples.
-	In the link to your ImageJ script, you can just type ‘Particle_ImageJ_script.txt’ instead of the full GitHub link.
